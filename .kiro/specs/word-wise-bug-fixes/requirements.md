# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DissertAI Writing Assistant is a React-based application similar to Grammarly that provides AI-powered writing assistance including grammar checking, argument mapping, citation suggestions, and other writing tools. The application is currently 85% functional but has critical TypeScript compilation errors and integration issues preventing it from running properly. This spec addresses fixing these blocking issues to make the application fully functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to compile without TypeScript errors, so that I can run the development server and test the application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm run type-check` THEN the system SHALL complete without any TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN I run `npm run dev` THEN the system SHALL start the development server successfully without compilation failures
3. IF there are missing type dependencies THEN the system SHALL have all required @types packages installed
4. WHEN TypeScript processes the codebase THEN all type annotations SHALL be correct and consistent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the rich text editor to display and function properly, so that I can write and edit documents without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the application THEN the RichEditor component SHALL render without prop type errors
2. WHEN I type in the editor THEN the content SHALL update properly without undefined value errors
3. WHEN grammar errors are detected THEN the highlights SHALL display correctly with proper type matching
4. WHEN I interact with the editor THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to prop types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the grammar checking feature to work reliably, so that I can receive real-time writing assistance without application crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type text in the editor THEN the grammar checker SHALL analyze the text without throwing errors
2. WHEN grammar errors are found THEN they SHALL be highlighted in the editor with correct positioning
3. WHEN I click "Fix" on a grammar error THEN the correction SHALL be applied properly
4. WHEN the grammar checking component updates THEN there SHALL be no infinite re-render loops

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all AI writing tools to function properly, so that I can access the full range of writing assistance features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on any AI tool tab THEN the tool SHALL load without errors
2. WHEN I run an AI tool analysis THEN the system SHALL handle API responses correctly
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
4. WHEN using tools that require OpenAI API THEN the system SHALL handle authentication properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling throughout the application, so that runtime errors are caught and handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in async operations THEN they SHALL be properly typed and handled
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the application SHALL not crash but display user-friendly error states
4. WHEN debugging THEN error messages SHALL provide sufficient information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the document management features to work reliably, so that I can create, save, and manage my documents without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new document THEN it SHALL be created successfully and appear in the sidebar
2. WHEN I save a document THEN the save operation SHALL complete without errors
3. WHEN I switch between documents THEN the editor SHALL update properly with the correct content
4. WHEN I delete a document THEN the operation SHALL complete and the UI SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application architecture to be maintainable and follow best practices, so that future development and debugging is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all TypeScript types SHALL be properly defined and consistent
2. WHEN components communicate THEN prop interfaces SHALL match exactly between parent and child components
3. WHEN state management occurs THEN Zustand stores SHALL have proper typing
4. WHEN API integrations are implemented THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns and error handling
